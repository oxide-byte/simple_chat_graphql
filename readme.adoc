= Simple Chat GraphQL

This is a simple POC for Rust GraphQL containing Query, Mutation and Subscription for
Server and Client.

The code is executable, but contains not a correct design to represent a Chat Client/Server
application. The code is only written in purpose to prepare an AWS AppSync application.
